# Quesadilla

This project is the product of our interests in learning more about Web3.0 and wanting to develop new skills in front-end and back-end. Through this hack we were compelled to learn about MongoDB, smart contracts, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and much more. Mainly, because we wanted to test our limits as first year students and try to have a fun experience. However, it should be noted that though we tried our best we are aware that our results are not optimal, but they are the fruit of passionate hours of research and trial and error.

Our project is a mock social media that aimed to make more transparent interactions between individuals following the principles of blockchain. Our goal was to initialize the session with Metamask to enter a quesadilla social media site that allowed users to interact with other users. It is built on React, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

We were challenged in a completely new way as we learned new languages, concepts, and frameworks in the span of 2 days. In spite of the setbacks that we experienced in this process, we are grateful to have experienced this learning curve and discover new topics that we would otherwise never know.
